# Section 8 Bootstrap Overview

## Bootstrap Introduction

### What is Framework?

* Framework defines the rules for you to follow
    * Tells how you can manipulate the code
* Large part: how to reference the doc for your own use cases

### Bootstrap V3 VS V4

* We won't notice any difference
* The most important thing is to reference to documentation
* getbootstrap.com -> download Bootstrap
* Use CDN, i.e. content delivery network, pretty much similar as we use google fonts
* The documentation for each component is [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/alerts/).
