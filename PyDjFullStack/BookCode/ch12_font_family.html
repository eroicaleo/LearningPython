    Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is
    a large breed of dog traditionally used as
    a herder and guardian of sheep...</p>

    <h2>Breed History</h2>
    <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated from France.
      They were originally bred to herd and guard flocks of sheep, and they were
      often left to their own devices to accomplish their assigned tasks.
      This makes the Briard different from those breeds that only guard and
      those that only herd. The breeds that just herd are often smaller in size,
      agile, and swift of foot. Those breeds that just guard are usually larger
      and heavier. Briards were used in all types of herding situations.
