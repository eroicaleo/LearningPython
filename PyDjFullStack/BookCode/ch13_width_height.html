        <td class="description">Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid,
          also known as GEB, is a 1979 book by Douglas Hofstadter. By exploring
          common themes in the lives and works of logician Kurt Gödel,
          artist M. C. Escher, and composer Johann Sebastian Bach, the book
           expounds concepts fundamental to mathematics, symmetry, and
            intelligence. Through illustration and analysis, the book discusses
          how, through self-reference and formal rules, systems can acquire
          meaning despite being made of "meaningless" elements. It also
          discusses what it means to communicate, how knowledge can be represented
          and stored, the methods and limitations of symbolic representation,
          and even the fundamental notion of "meaning" itself.
          In response to confusion over the book's theme, Hofstadter emphasized
          that Gödel, Escher, Bach is not about the relationships of
          mathematics, art, and music—but rather about how cognition emerges
          from hidden neurological mechanisms. One point in the book presents
          an analogy about how individual neurons in the brain coordinate to
          create a unified sense of a coherent mind by comparing it to the
          social organization displayed in a colony of ants.</td>

    <h2 class="fender">Fender Mustang</h2>
    <p id="fender1">
      The Fender Mustang is a solid body electric guitar produced by
      the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. It was introduced in 1964
      as the basis of a major redesign of Fender's student models, the
      Musicmaster and Duo-Sonic. It was produced until 1982 and reissued in 1990.
      In the 1990s, the Mustang attained cult status largely as a result of
      its use by a number of alternative rock bands, in particular grunge
      bands. Early examples are generally seen as the most collectible of
      all the short-scale Fender guitars.
      The Mustang features two single-coil pickups, an unusual pickup
      switching configuration, and a unique vibrato system. It was originally
      available in two scale lengths, 24 and 22.5 inches.
