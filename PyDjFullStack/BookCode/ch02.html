    that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
    start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
    line.</p>

    <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up
    into units of text. For example, a book may have
    chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under

    paragraphs.</p>

    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
    an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
    of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
    the other scientific journals her work had
    appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
    The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
    since college, and the longer she spent in these
    four walls the more she felt she needed to be
    free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
    sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
    proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
    people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
    many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
    the secrets of the llama <abbr
    title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
    outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
    she had something better to do.</p>
