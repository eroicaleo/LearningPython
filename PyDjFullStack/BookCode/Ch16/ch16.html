          <b><i>Magnolia</i></b> is a large genus that contains over 200 flowering plant
          species. It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol and, having
          evolved before bees appeared, the flowers were developed to encourage
          pollination by beetle.

          Some magnolias, such as <i>Magnolia stellata</i> and
          <i>Magnolia soulangeana</i>, flower quite early in the spring before
          the leaves open. Others flower in late spring or early summer, such as
          <i>Magnolia grandiflora</i>.
