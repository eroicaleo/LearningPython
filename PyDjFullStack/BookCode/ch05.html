      Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid, also known as
       GEB, is a 1979 book by Douglas Hofstadter. By exploring common
        themes in the lives and works of logician Kurt Gödel,
        artist M. C. Escher, and composer Johann Sebastian Bach,
        the book expounds concepts fundamental to mathematics, symmetry,
         and intelligence. Through illustration and analysis, the book
          discusses how, through self-reference and formal rules,
           systems can acquire meaning despite being made of
        "meaningless" elements. It also discusses what it means to
       communicate, how knowledge can be represented and stored, the
        methods and limitations of symbolic representation, and even
         the fundamental notion of "meaning" itself.</p>
