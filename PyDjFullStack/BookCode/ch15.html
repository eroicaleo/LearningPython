      <h1 class="normal-flow">The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
      <p class="normal-flow">In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine
         that would help him get around the royal gardens faster:
         two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame
         upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet
         against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a
         sort of gliding walk.
      </p>

      <p class="normal-flow">
        The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made
        entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not
        being practical for transportation in any other place than a well
        maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.
      </p>

      <p class="normal-flow">
        The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when
        pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known
        as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker,"
        since its wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the
        day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and
        indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in
        large cities.
