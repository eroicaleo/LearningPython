\title{Chapter 27 Class Coding Basics}
\maketitle

In this chapter, it is mainly about three topics:

class can have multiple instances.\\

class can inherit from base class.\\

class can overload operators.\\

\section{Classes generate multiple object instances.}
top level assignments generate class attributes.
Each instance gets its own namespace.
We could even define new attribute for an instance, but doesnâ€™t make too much sense to do so. Because the method in the class will not use them.

\section{Classes are customized by Inheritance}

\textbf{\textit{How a superclass accesses the method or data in a subclass?}}

\section{Classes can intercept python operators}

We will use the \_\_\textsl{X}\_\_ to define the operator.
