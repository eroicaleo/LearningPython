# Chapter 1

* The goal of this book, define what design and architecture are?
  For starters, no difference, none at all.
* Architect who designed home, what is architecture? shape/outward appearance/etc
  but in diagrams, see all the low-level details.
* low level details support high level desicions, all part of the whole design
* A continuum of desicions from the highest to the lowest levels.

## The Goal

* The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build
  and maintain the required system.
* The measure of design quality is the effort.
* Low effort, high quality, just that simple.
