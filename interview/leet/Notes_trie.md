* Trie: problem 336
    * problem 208
    * problem 212
    * problem 211
    * A very simple implementation with `dict` in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11015320/how-to-create-a-trie-in-python)
      I and Stefan used this one in 211
    * Google's implementation: [github](https://github.com/google/pygtrie)

* Trie problem can add more information to a node, in addition to `_end_`
    * like `336_Palindrome_Pairs.py`, I added `_palindrome_`
